<b>Strangelove</b>

There'll be times
When my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life liveable
But when you think I've had enough
From your sea of love
I'll take more than another riverfull
And I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Strangelove
Strange high and strange lows
Strangelove
That's how my love goes
Strangelove
Will you give it to me
Will you take the pain
I will give to you
Again and again
And will you return it

There'll be days
When I'll stray
I may appear to be
Constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach
I'm not trying to say
I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn
When you've got something to teach
And I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Pain will you return it
I'll say it again - pain
Pain will you return it
I won't say it again

I give in
Again and again
I give in
Will you give it to me
I give in
I'll say it again
I give in

I give in
Again and Again
I give in
That's how my love goes
I give in
I'll say it again
I give in


<b>Barrel of a gun</b>

Do you mean this horny creep
set upon weary feet
who looks in need of sleep
that doesn’t come
this twiked, tortured mess
this bed of sinfulness
who’s longing for some rest
and telling numb

What do you expect of me
what is it you want
whatever you’ve planned for me
I’m not the one

A vicious appetite
visits me each night
and won’t be satisfied
won’t be denied
an unbearable pain
a beating in my brain
that leaves the mark of cain
right here inside

What am I supposed to do
when everything that I’ve done
is leading me to conclude
I’m not the one

Whatever I’ve done
I’ve been starting down the barrel of a gun

Is there something you need from me
are you having your fun
I never agreed to be
your holy one

Whatever I’ve done
I’ve been starting down the barrel of a gun.

<b>It's no good</b>

I'm going to take my time
I have all the time in the world
to make your mine
it is written in the stars above
the gods decree
you'll be right here by my side
right next to me
you can run, but you cannot hide

Don't say you want me
don't say you need me
don't say you love me
it's understood
don't say you're happy
out there without me
I know you can't be
'cause it's no good

I'll be fine
I'll be waiting patiently
till you see the signs
and come running to my open arms
when will you realise
do we have to wait till our worlds collide
open up your eyes
you can't turn back the tide

Don't say you want me
don't say you need me
don't say you love me
it's understood
don't say you're happy
out there without me
I know you can't be
'cause it's no good

I'm going to take my time
I have all the time in the world
to make your mine
it is written in the stars above.

<b>Diesel Power</b>

Yo!
I used to check out
lyrics upon the format
Build will skill with technique
computer a-dat

My lyrical form is
clouds on your brainstorm
I get hyped
Think thought flow
Acrobat!

Sink the track
Pump the track
Trancemissions
Close like spores react past
Those visions

And Hurrying more
Reflects on the dancefloor
Blowing up
And having mad people showing up
Packing crowds
Jam packed venues

Needles collapse
While atmosphere continues
Sprinkle that
Winnin'like that
Movein'like that
Hittin'like that
The melody is phat
Yeah, I'm on the energy source
The cosmic force
With Prodigy
Kicking astrology
My intellect's devour

With Diesel Power
Blows your mind drastically fantastically (3x)

We spin back rewind
Diesel Power
Blows your mind drastically fantastically
It has to be
Automatically
Check it out
You better work it out
Dreams to another bout
My techniques strategies abilities
will leave cordless mics hanging
like Spring Leads
Do a track so fast
beyond the human eye
Lyrical tactics
Vocal gymnastics
Ease and pepped up
You get swept up
Smacked up
Backed up
Your crew's all cracked up
Checking flow
Pick choose quick
You can't stick
My medical range is
Stranges as angles
You get tangled
Twisting inside a fraction
Channels repeat,complete
Can't complete
Check the
hour 'n texture
Mind adventure
Exploit the point
into tracks
to devour
my intellects proceed

with diesel power
Blows your mind drastically fantastically (3x)

Back attack
the wack pack the fax to me
You don't want none
High quality action should B
Still standing
Damaging your other manner
Quick reverse
Potent as the first verse
My amplifier
blows on your world's higher
Word's sire
Cuts like a barbed wire
Record player
I pull up
on you every day
Fast-forward
I move
and I swing towards it
Exit-Load
Put your brain in right mode
Selective mix
The man will perfect the fix
Heads lightly bite me
Copy Xerox
Cops' handblocks
You can't knock
them outthere
I'll keep lifting
shifting,persistent
intelligent kingpin
Given astrology
As I roll with Prodigy

With Diesel Power
Blows your mind drastically fantastically (4x)

<b>The Promisse</b>
by When in Rome

When you need a friend,
don't look to a stranger,
You know in the end,
I'll always be there.

But when you're in doubt,
and when you're in danger,
Take a look all around,
and I'll be there.

I'm sorry,
but I'm just thinking
of the right words to say.
I know they don't sound the way
I planned them to be.
But if you'll wait around awhile,
I'll make you fall for me,
I promise you,
I promise you I will.

When your day is through,
and so is your temper,
You know what to do,
I'm gonna always be there.
 
Sometimes if I shout,
it's not what's intended.
These words just come out,
with no gripe to bear.

I'm sorry, 
but I'm just thinking
of the right words to say.
I know they don't sound the way
I planned them to be.
But if you'll wait around awhile,
I'll make you fall for me,
I promise you, I promise you...

I'm sorry, 
but I'm just thinking
of the right words to say.
I know they don't sound the way 
I planned them to be.
And if I had to walk the world,
I'd make you fall for me, 
I promise you,
I promise you I will.

I gotta tell you,
I gotta tell you,
I need to tell you...

I'm sorry,
but I'm just thinking
of the right words to say.
I know they don't sound the way
I planned them to be.
But if you'll wait around awhile,
I'll make you fall for me,
I promise you,
I promise you...

I'm sorry, 
but I'm just thinking
of the right words to say.
I know they don't sound the way 
I planned them to be.
And if I had to walk the world,
I'd make you fall for me, 
I promise you,
I promise you I will.
I will. I will.
